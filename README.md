# Eco Gamification Study Summary 🌱

This project explores how gamified design influences environmental behavior.
Using survey data from 61 respondents, I identified:

### Key Findings
- 15% engagement drop among high-awareness users  
- Motivation correlated with reward visibility  
- Habit loops created predictable re-engagement patterns  

### Web3 Application
- Similar mechanics power DeFi/GameFi incentives  
- Tokenized rewards can boost long-term participation  
- Behavioral data helps optimize treasury & community incentives  

This project builds my foundation in tokenomics, user research, and behavioral design.
